# New-Vinesauce-ROM-Corruptor
A UI overhaul for [Rikerz's](https://github.com/rikerz) excellent [VRC](https://github.com/Rikerz/VRC).

## Why?
Vinesauce's corruption videos are by far some of the most entertaining video game videos I have watched.  Rikerz's tool is great, but it's a little dated and hasn't been updated in a few years.  This project aims to update the UI and package the corruption code into a nice, neat package.

## What's new?
The original VRC is written using Windows forms, a rather outdated looking technology.  This new repository adds a nicer WPF interface.

## What works?
Currently, NVRC has limited functionality.  The checklist below shows progress.
